                    I graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences. Having always been fascinated with wonders of how the world works, I naturally enjoyed learning math and science while I grew up. My interest eventually led me to do well in math and science, and I hope to continue pursuing higher academics related to these fields.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    During my undergraduate years, I was involved in research in Immunology and Clinical Psychology. I enjoyed collaborating with my professors in tackling the latest challenges in the healthcare and science community, which eventually led me to publish and present my research accomplishments in national conferences and to my undergraduate class. Outside of school I shadowed doctors and volunteered in hospitals to learn about and provide Palliative Care. Learning from my professional mentors was the greatest reward of my college education.

                <p class="indent">
                    I never believed that understanding concepts of math and science was hard, and I think this is in part due to having great teachers in the past. There were moments when I hit hard walls; however, my teachers were very patient at breaking down concepts and guiding the students through step-by-step. Having been influenced by my mentors, I carry this belief everywhere I tutor my students.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Moving away from college now, I wish to continue helping students in STEM subjects. I would also love to hear about my students' goals and share with them some advice and resources, such as those related to extracurricular activities or recommendation letters, to help them achieve their dreams.
                </p>

                    Brian scored 800 on his SAT math section, 800 on SAT II Chemistry, 770 on SAT Math II-C, and 99th percentile on his MCAT science section.
                    He has been an 1-on-1 tutor at Premier Academy and a SAT & ACT instructor at Flex College Prep for 4 years.
                    Besides teaching, he is a freelance programmer, and enjoys reading about physics and the Bible, watching various kinds of movies, playing basketball, and traveling.

                    I graduated from University of Southern California with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences and minors in Business and Psychology. During my undergraduate years, I was involved in research in neuroendocrinology. Outside of school I volunteered in the emergency room at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center. Currently I am working towards my goal, which is to attend medical school.

                    Despite my background and goals being grounded in science, I also have a strong foundation in English. Growing up I was a very avid reader, resulting in strong reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. I also took reading and writing classes outside of school to further develop my aptitude. I realized the value and necessity of these skills as they helped me in learning and doing well in all other subjects. Having tutored students in English before, I noticed marked improvement in other areas along with their progress in English. I hope to continue helping those who struggle with reading and writing to move forward in their educational endeavors.
